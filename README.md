Computational Roadmap for Lipidomics in R: From Raw Data to Functional Insight
# Code 1
Implementation of a reproducible data cleaning and exploratory visualization pipe-line. This script outlines a standardized workflow for the initial processing of lipidomic datasets using the tidyverse ecosystem. The pipeline initiates with high-speed data in-gestion via the readr package, followed by a sequential series of operations linked by the pipe operator (%>%). Key steps include: 1.Feature Filtration: The removal of in-complete observations (NAs) to maintain data integrity. 2.Variance Stabilization: Ap-plication of a log_{10} transformation to mitigate heteroscedasticity and normalize the intensity distribution. 3. Class-level Aggregation: Utilizing group_by and summarise to collapse individual lipid species into broader biological classes for trend identification.
