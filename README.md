Computational Roadmap for Lipidomics in R: From Raw Data to Functional Insight
# Code 1
Implementation of a reproducible data cleaning and exploratory visualization pipe-line. This script outlines a standardized workflow for the initial processing of lipidomic datasets using the tidyverse ecosystem. The pipeline initiates with high-speed data in-gestion via the readr package, followed by a sequential series of operations linked by the pipe operator (%>%). Key steps include: 1.Feature Filtration: The removal of in-complete observations (NAs) to maintain data integrity. 2.Variance Stabilization: Ap-plication of a log_{10} transformation to mitigate heteroscedasticity and normalize the intensity distribution. 3. Class-level Aggregation: Utilizing group_by and summarise to collapse individual lipid species into broader biological classes for trend identification.

# Code 2
Quality control filtering and normalization pipeline using specialized lipidomics packages. This implementation demonstrates the transition from raw feature tables to a normalized LipidomicsExperiment object. The script utilizes lipidr to execute a rig-orous QC filter, removing features with a CV > 30% in pooled QC samples to eliminate unstable variables. Subsequently, it applies Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (PQN) to stabilize the dataset against concentration-induced variations. The workflow concludes with a boxplot-based assessment (plot_samples), providing a visual confir-mation of variance stabilization across the sample cohort.
