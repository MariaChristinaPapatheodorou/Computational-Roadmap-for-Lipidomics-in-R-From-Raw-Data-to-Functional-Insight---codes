# Example of QC filtering and normalization using lipidr
# Input: Tidy data frame with 'Lipid', 'Sample', and 'Intensity' columns. lipidr converts this into a LipidomicsExperiment object, inheriting from SummarizedExperiment.
library(lipidr)
# Create a LipidomicsExperiment object (assuming data is already tidied)
lipid_ex <- as_lipidomics_experiment(clean_data)
# Filter lipids with high CV in QC samples (> 30%)
# lipid_ex inherits from SummarizedExperiment, enabling compatibility with Bioconductor workflows
lipid_ex <- filter_low_cv(lipid_ex, measure = "Area", threshold = 0.3)
# Perform PQN normalization
lipid_ex_norm <- normalize_pqn(lipid_ex, measure = "Area")
# Visualizing the effect of normalization
